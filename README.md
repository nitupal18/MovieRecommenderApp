# Tools used 
### Streamlit,TMDB, Scikit-learn tools such as CountVectorizer to count the frequency of words, PosterStemmer to stem the words to their base, pandas, pickel etc.
# How to clone this App
#### Step 0: Download the source code
#### step 1: open PythonCode.ipynb file in jupyter or your favorite IDE import the required install the required libraries and import the required tools and build the model.
#### step 2: Now you can build the app in any IDE for python development by opening app.py file, I used pycharm. Now install streamlit, streamlit is an open source python framework for building web apps.
#### step 3: Now you need to import the model which you have already built using pickel. The code for pickling is already there in PythonCode.ipynb file.
